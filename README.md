# ANN-bankChurn_Model  

### Description  

Here we've a dataset of a bank. There are 10 thousand rows(entries) in the dataset. The bank has been seeing unusual churn rates, they've seen customers leaving the bank at unusually high rates and they want to understand what the problem is and they want to address that problem. So the dataset having all the information about the customer from past 6 months . So 6 months down the track we're going to check who of the customers left and who of those customers stayed. And that's what one of the column of dataset 'Exited' represents from past 6 months. So 1 means the person' no longer with the bank and 0 represents the person is still with the bank.  


So the goal is to create a model to predict which of the customers are at high risk of leaving.
